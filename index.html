In 2008, Mr Astin was appointed Assistant Principal of our sister school, Harris City Academy Crystal Palace.  After that, he was a leader of the Harris Sixth Form and later the Principal of Harris Girls’ Academy Bromley. 

During this time, he helped to lay the educational foundations of the Harris Westminster Sixth Form, a collaboration with Westminster School which aims to prepare London’s brightest state school pupils for entry to the world’s best universities. Mr Astin, who lives in Beckenham with his young family, was appointed Executive Principal of Harris Academy Orpington in September 2018.<br>

Richard has a passion for student welfare and feels that all students must have the opportunity for a great academic education, develop their wider understanding of a modern Britain and become well-rounded young adults in the process.

As a local resident, he is fully aware of the need for a great school, serving the local community and welcomes any feedback from parents and carers.

Richard was appointed as the Head of Academy in Easter 2019 and is exceptionally proud of all the students and their achievements.<br>

                        <p class="P_modal">Bryoney, born and raised in Northern Ireland, is a graduate from Queens University Belfast, where she studied English with Film Studies. During this time, she completed an accredited course entitled ‘Tutoring in Schools Programme,’ where her love of teaching began. She then went on to gain a City and Guilds Qualification in Teaching in Further and Higher Education. Whilst looking for her first teaching role, she managed to secure a position teaching English in Cambridge International School for Girls in Doha, Qatar. Following her year abroad, Bryoney moved to London in 2010 to attend the University of Greenwich, where she completed a PGCE in Primary Education and proudly accepted an NQT offer in her placement school.

Bryoney is a unique asset to Harris Orpington, as she is an experienced Primary leader. During her seven years at different Primary schools Bryoney has worn many hats; including Head of House, Drama Lead, Music Lead, Head of Literacy, Lead Practitioner and Assistant Head. Her move to a secondary school has been a fantastic opportunity for us to use her knowledge of the Primary curriculum and pedagogical methods, to support our latest cohort of Year 7s and the staff who teach them. Bryoney worked hard through our first lockdown in 2020 to ensure the children joining us had a supportive curriculum in place to ease their transition; not just from Primary to Secondary; but to ease their return to school after such an unprecedented, prolonged absence. <br>
